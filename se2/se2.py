def pythagorean_triple(a, b, c):
    """
    Determine whether a, b, c form an Pythagorean triple of the form 
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2. a,b,c are positive integers.
    
    Inputs:
        a (int): the first number
        b (int): the second number
        c (int): the third number

    Returns (boolean): True if a, b, and c form an Pythagorean triple, 
       False otherwise.

    ### the correct value as specified above
    pass


def first_odd_value(lst):
    """
    Determine the first odd value in the list. 

    Args:
        lst (list of ints): the list

    Returns (int): The first odd value. The function returns zero if there are
                   no odd values in the list

def clip_in_range(lst, lb, ub):
    """
    Modify the input list so that all of the values are between lb and ub,
    inclusive. For example, if lst = [1,4,11,9,23], lb = 2 and ub=10, the
    function should modify lst in place and change it to [2,4,10,9,10]

    Args:

def flatten_columns(lst):
    """ 
    Flatten a list of lists into a single list column-wise.
