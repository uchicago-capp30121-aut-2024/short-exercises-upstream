    Find the number of divisors a and b have in common.  You should include 1 as a common divisor in your count.
    You may assume that a <= b. 
    For e.g. if a = 12 and b = 18, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so the answer is 4. If a = 4 and b = 8, the common divisors are 1, 2 and 4, so the answer is 3.
